🗂️ Dayflow – Human Resource Management System (HRMS)

Every workday, perfectly aligned.

Dayflow is a modern, role-based Human Resource Management System designed to digitize and streamline core HR operations such as employee management, attendance tracking, leave approvals, and payroll visibility.

This project is being developed as part of a hackathon, with a strong focus on clean UI/UX, modular frontend architecture, and real-world HR workflows.
